## üî¥ About This Project
<p align="justify">This project was developed as a way for me and my team to dive into the third-person action genre. Through this project, I gained valuable insights into the intricacies of game development, from crafting engaging combat mechanics to creating dynamic code for the purpose of futureproofing.</p>

## ‚ô¶Ô∏èAbout Game
<p align="justify">Feline Parrymaster is a third-person action-adventure game set in a mystical world. You play as a legendary sword-wielding cat who battles fierce enemies like orcs, using unique parrying skills to deflect both melee and projectile attacks with a mix of fast-paced combat. The game challenges players to master the art of parrying and become a true feline swordmaster.</p>

<br>

## üéÆ Gameplay
<p align="justify">Feline Parrymaster is all about mastering two types of parries: projectile parry and close-range parry! Play as a sword-wielding cat, deflecting enemy attacks with precise timing to defeat fierce foes like orcs. The game challenges you to perfect your parry skills and counter with powerful strikes.</p>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Game Mechanics I Created
### Projectile Parry
![parryProjectile](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d80f566-8dda-4725-94a9-0cb04950b986)

- Logic is located within the `PCombat.cs` script
- It functions similarly to a normal attack but targets projectiles instead of enemies.
- When the player performs this action, the system looks for incoming projectiles in the area.
- Upon hitting a projectile, the force of the projectile is reversed.
- The projectile is then launched back at the enemy who originally fired it.

### Combo System

</p>

- Logic is located within the `PCombat.cs` script
- The code is dynamic, allowing for flexibility in the number of combos the player can perform.
- A list of classes called "Combos" is used to handle the combo system, with the length of the list determining the amount of moves available to the player.
- The system functions by starting a timer each time the player performs a normal attack.
- If the player doesn't attack within a certain time, the combo is reset to the first move.
- If the player continues attacking within the given time, the combo progresses to the next move in the list.
- Once the combo reaches the final move, the sequence resets back to the first move, allowing the player to start the combo over.
