## ♦️About Game
<p align="justify">Feline Parrymaster is a third-person action-adventure game set in a mystical world. You play as a legendary sword-wielding cat who battles fierce enemies like orcs, using unique parrying skills to deflect both melee and projectile attacks with a mix of fast-paced combat. The game challenges players to master the art of parrying and become a true feline swordmaster.</p>

<br>

## 🎮 Gameplay
<!-- <p align="justify">Players engage in intense combat, dodging and countering threats using weapons like machete, katana, and hammer. As they progress, they will face tougher enemies and adapt to new challenges. The game currently features 2 levels, and we plan to add more in future updates.</p> -->
